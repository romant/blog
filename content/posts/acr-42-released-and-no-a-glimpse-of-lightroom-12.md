Many souls weren't happy that Adobe didn't support Canon's 40D when they got it, in ACR and consequently in Lightroom.

Now you can jump for joy - as right now [ACR](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html) supports 40D

Also note that on the page it lists Lightroom 1.2 as available also, <s>yet this has been reportedly false.</s> which is available for download [over at Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/)
