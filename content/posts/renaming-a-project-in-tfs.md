title: Renaming a Project in TFS
---

I’ve recently decided to try out Microsoft’s latest incarnation of Team Foundation Server; a document and code versioning, as well as defect tracking system for developers.

Since TFS manages source code, as well as documents, it is an extremely convenient repository of data for your projects; yet - by putting all your eggs in the one basket, you may be unpleasantly surprised when you decide to rename your project. In Team Foundation Server 2005, this ‘feature’ was absent, if you were hoping to find it in 2008 – stop looking, there are too many <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2462725&SiteID=1">DB references</a> to update. We can only hope that Microsoft will bring about a tool to do this as part of a service pack.
