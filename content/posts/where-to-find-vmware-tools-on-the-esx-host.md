title: Where to find VMware tools on the ESX host
---

Whenever you update your host, there's a chance that VMware tools have been updated.

To get them, head over to "/vmimages/tools-isoimages" on the host and you'll be greeted with:

If you're just after the `rpm` then rip open the ISO and you're done.
