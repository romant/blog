title: Canon 40D + Lightroom Auto-Rotate
---

Cameras these days record the orientation of the camera when you take a shot, and write this into EXIF which is embedded into the photo. There seems to be a new way in which the 40D does it.![Adobe Lightroom 40D Auto rotate](/images/2007/09/lightroom-import-40d.jpg)

If anyone has attempted to import from 40D into Lightroom, they might notice that all the images are rotated 180%.

Windows picks up the correct way up, yet Lightroom simply doesn't.

I hope Adobe will be quick to remedy this problem, as well as update the RAW converter to accommodate the 40D

## Update

Having a further look into it - I noticed this only occurs when you connect the camera directly to the computer, as opposed to extract the CF, and using it within a reader.

Also windows didn't automatically rotate the photos when looking at them through explorer, so possibly this is a Windows Vista problem, and not Lightroom.

If anyone in XP or OSX can reproduce this - do post.

## Update 2

After trying this with Lightroom 1.3 - the issue still persists.

Not fixed yet.
