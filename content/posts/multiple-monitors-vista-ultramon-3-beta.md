Am an avid supporter of multi-monitor set-ups. Once you end up using two or more screens - it's very hard to go back down to one.

***

At the moment my set-up consists of:

2x [Samsung 940B](http://www.samsung.com/au/products/monitors/tft/940b.asp)'s
  
1x IBM/Lenovo [Advanced Mini Dock](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkPad_Advanced_Mini_Dock)
  
1x T60 [[ATI Mobility Radeon x1400](http://ati.amd.com/products/MobilityRadeonx1400/index.html)]

Works quite well, as soon as it's docked, it recognises the two monitors (one plugged in using VGA, other DVI), and off it goes.

***

In Windows, it's quite simple - plug in another monitor, and through Display Settings - select where each screen is relatively to the others.

Unfortunately, even in Windows Vista - 5th Version of the monolithic, GUI - OS [95,98, 2000,XP, ->Vista), it is has yet to cater for a spanning taskbar, one that would cross all monitors.

That and other shortcomings are fixed by a nice program called [UltraMon](http://realtimesoft.com/ultramon/). It allows for a multitude of features concerning multiple monitors. One's that I use:

* the spanning taskbar
* Windows Title Bar

> Puts icons near the close button of the window, that allow you to quickly with a click, move the windows to another monitor, or stretch it across all monitors 

* Wallpaper

> Finally - a tool which looks at setting distinct wallpapers for each screen, that is easy to use, and is persistent across reboots as well as docking/undocking my T60

Now with UltraMon 3 Beta - you can finally use it in Vista.

Several problems though:

  * Docking the laptop - Causes multiple taskbars to be rendered on the secondary display 

  * Freezing whenever some applications are launched - ie. [FileZilla](http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/)

With all these, am still a hapy camper, and absolutely love the app. Just hope they hurry up, and release the final.
